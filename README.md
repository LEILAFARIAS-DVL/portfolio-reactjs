This project, Portfolio React App, was developed using Create React App, a powerful tool for bootstrapping React projects with optimized configurations. It provides an agile and efficient development experience, enabling the creation of modern and responsive web applications.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing the development of reusable components and a declarative UI. 💡
- JavaScript: The primary programming language for web development, providing dynamic and interactive features for the application. 💻
- HTML/CSS: Fundamental languages for structuring and styling web pages, ensuring visually appealing and accessible presentation. 🎨

Additionally, this project includes scripts for running, testing, and building the application, as well as information on deployment and troubleshooting common issues during development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **yarn start:** Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. 🚀
- **yarn test:** Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. 🧪
- **yarn build:** Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. 📦
